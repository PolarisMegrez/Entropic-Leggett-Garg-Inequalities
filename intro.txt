\section{\added{Introduction}}

Quantum mechanics (QM) provides profound insights into atomic and subatomic systems.
However,
it exhibits some counterintuitive features,
such as nonlocality \cite{HHHH09} and contextuality \cite{BCG+22},
which are fundamentally incompatible with the classical perspective on macroscopic systems.
Over recent decades,
the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena has attracted considerable attention,
largely due to the experimental advances which facilitate the preparation and detection of macroscopic quantum states \cite{FSD+18}.
Although superconductivity \cite{MGC63} and superfluidity \cite{Leg99} are frequently cited as paradigms of ``macroscopic quantum phenomena'',
Leggett \cite{Leg80} argued that these are merely macroscopic accumulations of microscopic quantum effects,
and hence insufficient to determine whether the quantum mechanical description can be extrapolated to macroscopic system.
Instead,
Leggett proposed that the superposition of macroscopically distinguishable state could serve as a more convincing experimental evidence.

To this end,
a method capable of distinguishing genuine quantum superposition from classical statistical mixtures is needed.
Leggett \added{and Garg} \cite{LG85,Leg08} introduced a definition of ``classical worldview'' known as macrorealism,
constituted of two principal assumptions:
(1) Macroscopic realism: 
A macroscopic system with two or more macroscopically distinct states available to it will at all times be in one or the other of these states;
(2) Noninvasive measurability at the macroscopic level:
It is possible, in principle, to determine the state of the system with arbitrarily small perturbation on its subsequent dynamics.
Analogous to Bell inequalities \cite{Fin82},
Leggett and Garg \cite{LG85} showed that the temporal correlations must obey a class of inequalities under macrorealism,
for instance,
\begin{eqnarray}
1+C_{12}+C_{23}+C_{13}\ge0\ ,&\\
|C_{12}+C_{23}+C_{14}-C_{24}|\le2\ ,&
\end{eqnarray}
where $C_{ij}\equiv\braket{Q(t_{i})Q(t_{j})}$ signify the temporal correlation functions.
Violation of such Leggett--Garg inequalities (LGIs) sufficiently (not necessarily) indicate the failure of macrorealism,
which has been observed in varieties of experiments \cite{GAB+11,XLZG11,LDK+16,KKY+16},
thereby serving as an indicator of quantum coherence \cite{LECN10,SHLY18}.

It is noteworthy that the conditions of LGIs violation are broader than those necessity of characterizing the quantum coherence.
For instance,
a system initialized in a maximally mixed state remains maximally mixed under any unitary evolution;
nevertheless,
such a system can still violate certain LGIs \cite{KB07},
even though classified as completely incoherent by existing coherence measures \cite{SAP17}.
This happens because LGIs probe temporal correlations within the dynamical evolution \cite{ZHLG15},
rather properties of the state at a single instant.
Consequently,
the boundary between classical and quantum behaviors cannot be fully characterized by the density matrix alone,
the dynamical evolution properties of the system, which can be examined by LGIs,
should also be known.

Nevertheless,
LGIs are tailored to a fixed number of outcomes,
thus complicate the comparison across different physical quantities or systems,
and hinder the adaptation to realistic scenarios with detection inefficiencies \cite{CF12}.
An alternative approach to measure the temporal correlation is in form of Shannon entropy,
namely the entropic Leggett--Garg inequality (ELGI) \cite{DKSR13,Ras14}.
Whereas,
hitherto the existing ELGIs are all confined to two-point joint entropies.
It is thus of considerable interest to explore ELGIs involving higher-order temporal correlations,
which would offer enhanced detection sensitivity \cite{Hal19,MHL21} and manifest novel phenomena.

In this study,
we investigate the persistence of violation of entropic Leggett-Garg inequalities (ELGIs) at the macroscopic scale in the absence of nonlocal correlations.
To this end,
we introduce a systematic approach to derive ELGIs with high-order temporal correlations.
Furthermore,
we analyze ELGI violations in spin-$j$ system driven by a constant external field and examine their asymptotic behavior in the limit $j \to \infty$ through the WKB approximation.
Our analysis reveals that,
in the regime where the WKB approximation is valid,
quantum violations persist but are negligible relative to the system size;
conversely,
when the WKB approximation breaks down,
the system rapidly reaches the maximal quantum violation of $\ln(2j+1)$.
These findings delineate clear boundaries for the experimental testing of entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities at the macroscopic scale.

\section{Entropic Leggett--Garg inequality}\label{sec1}

We begin by recounting the experimental scheme proposed by Leggett and Garg \cite{LG85} in deriving the LGIs. Given an observable $Q$, which can be treated as a variable mathematically, to measure it in an experiment non-invasively, one performs a series of measurements at some or all points of $n$ potential times $(t_{1},\cdots,t_{n})$. In the $\alpha$-th individual experiment, measurements are conducted at $d$ points of those $n$ times in sequence to acquire multipoint joint probabilities $p\big(q^{(\alpha)}(t_{i}),q^{(\alpha)}(t_{j}),\cdots,q^{(\alpha)}(t_{l})\big)$, while the system remains undisturbed at remaining times. Here, $q^{(\alpha)}(t_i)$ denotes the measurement outcome of $Q$ at time $t_i$, the indices $i,j,\cdots,l\in\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$, and $\mathop{\mathrm{card}}\{i,j,\cdots,l\}=d$, as illustrated in \cref{fig:fig-1}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pic/ELGI-illustration.png}
\caption{{\bfseries Schematic representation of the experimental setting for ELGI.} The elementary type ELGI $\mathcal{D}_{2,3}=H(Q_{1},Q_{3},Q_{4})+H(Q_{1},Q_{2},Q_{4})-H(Q_{1},Q_{2},Q_{3},Q_{4})-H(Q_{1},Q_{4})\ge0$ is taken as an example, where $Q_{i}$ denotes $Q(t_{i})$ for simplicity. All the $M$ experiments begin with the same initial state $\hat{\rho}_{_{0}}$. The joint entropy must be obtained from independent experiments rather than derived from the marginal probability distribution of a single experiment with measurements at all time points, as later measurements could be affected by earlier ones.}\label{fig:fig-1}
\end{figure}

Suppose $M$ rounds of experiments are performed in total, each of which provides a joint entropy
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:Shannon}
H\big(Q^{(\alpha)}(t_{i}),\cdots ,Q^{(\alpha)}(t_{l})\big)=-\sum_{p}{p\big(q^{(\alpha)}(t_{i}),\cdots , q^{(\alpha)} (t_{l})\big)\ln{p\big(q^{(\alpha)}(t_{i}),\cdots , q^{(\alpha)}(t_{l})\big)}}\ .\ 
\end{equation}
Here, $Q^{(\alpha)}(t_{i})$ represents the variable $Q$ being measured in the $\alpha$-th experiment at $t_i$ time. The $M$ joint entropies can then be arranged into a vector $\vec{h}_{\text{obs}}\in\mathbb{R}^{M}$. It should be noted that $Q^{(\alpha)}(t_{i})$ and $Q^{(\beta)}(t_{i})$ are distinct random variables due to the potential disturbance induced in measurement, even if they are measured at the same time $t_{i}$. Consequently, there are  $d_{1}+\cdots+d_{M}$ random variables in total. In contrast, macrorealism posits that measurements are non-invasive, such that any measurement merely reveals the pre-existing value $q_{\text{pre}}{(t)}$ at time $t$ without perturbation, which leads to
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:macro-condition}
H\big(Q^{(\alpha)}(t_{i}),\cdots,Q^{(\alpha)}(t_{l})\big)=H\big(Q_{\text{pre}}(t_{i}),\cdots,Q_{\text{pre}}(t_{l})\big)\ ,
\end{equation}
for all the $M$ joint entropies. It should be noted that $Q_{\text{pre}}(t_{i})$ remains identical across all $M$ rounds of experiments; consequently, a macrorealistic model involves no more than $n$ random variables. Yeung \cite{Yeu97} proved that entropic vectors $\vec{h}_{\text{obs}}$ satisfying \cref{eqn:macro-condition} are confined within a convex cone $\Gamma_{\text{E}}\subset\mathbb{R}^{M}$. Therefore, observation of $\vec{h}_{\text{obs}}$ lying outside $\Gamma_{\text{E}}$ indicates violation of macrorealism. 

Now that a complete characterization of $\Gamma_{\text{E}}$ remains an open problem in information theory, we employ the Shannon cone $\Gamma_{\text{Sh}}$ defined by the non-negativity of conditional entropy and mutual information as an outer approximation, from which we derive two types of entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}_{i}:\!&=H(Q_{i}|Q_{\text{All}}-\{Q_{i}\})=H\big(Q_{\text{All}}\big)-H\big(Q_{\text{All}}-\{Q_{i}\}\big)\ge0\ ,\label{eqn:conditional-entropy}\\ 
\mathcal{D}_{i,j}:\!&=H(Q_{i};Q_{j}|Q_{\text{All}}-\{Q_{i},Q_{j}\})\notag\\
&=H\big(Q_{\text{All}}-\{Q_{i}\}\big)+H\big(Q_{\text{All}}-\{Q_{j}\}\big)- H\big(Q_{\text{All}}\big)-H\big(Q_{\text{All}}- \{Q_{i},Q_{j}\}\big)\ge0\ .\label{eqn:conditional-mutual-information}
\end{align}
Here, $Q_{\text{All}}=\{Q_{1},\cdots,Q_{n}\}$ with $Q_{i}$ denoting $Q^{\alpha}(t_{i})$ for simplicity. Yeung \cite{Yeu97} once demonstrated that these two types of inequalities provide a complete characterization of the Shannon cone; thus, $\mathcal{D}_{i}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{i,j}$ constitute two fundamental basis elements from which all other Shannon-type ELGIs can be systematically derived. For instance, the $n=3$ case of ELGI proposed by Devi {\itshape et al.} \cite{DKSR13}, though originally derived through a different method, can be expressed as $H(Q_{2}|Q_{1})+H(Q_{3}|Q_{2})-H(Q_{3}|Q_{1})=\mathcal{D}_{1,3}+\mathcal{D}_{2}\ge0$. This geometric approach parallels the method introduced by Chaves and Fritz for entropic Bell and contextuality inequalities \cite{FC13,CF12}.

A key advantage of our approach lies in its capacity of deriving ELGIs in higher order temporal correlation. As shown in \cref{fig:fig-2}, high-order ELGIs demonstrate increased violation both in magnitude and range, comparing to Devi's second-order ELGIs.  The enhanced sensitivity facilitates more effective detection of quantum behavior in temporal correlations, particularly in systems with intricate dynamics where two-point correlations might omit subtle characteristics, such as non-Markovian processes \cite{Ad05}.

\section{Entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities in large-spin system}\label{sec:large-spin}

Based on the general framework of entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities, we now turn to the spin-$j$ system and investigate the asymptotic behavior of ELGI violations in the limit $j\to+\infty$, to examine whether quantum properties are inevitably excluded by macrorealism at the macroscopic scale. 

Consider a spin system with Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = \omega \hat{J}_{y}$ and observable $\hat{Q} = \hat{J}_{z}$, in the Heisenberg picture, the projection operator corresponding to outcome $m_{i}$ measured at time $t_{i}$ is given by $\hat{\Pi}_{m_{i}}(t_{i}) = \hat{U}^\dagger\big(t_{i}\big)\ket{j,m_{i}}\bra{j,m_{i}}\hat{U}\big(t_{i}\big)$, where $\hat{U}(t)=\exp(-i\omega\hat{J}_{y}t/\hbar)$ denotes the unitary evolution operator. According to Leggett's experimental protocol, one conducts a series of measurements at time $t_{1},\dots,t_{k}$, resulting in outcomes $m_{1},\dots,m_{k}$ respectively. Quantum mechanics predicts the joint probabilities to be
\begin{align}
p(m_{1},\cdots,m_{k})&=\mathrm{Tr}\,\big(\hat{\Pi}_{m_{k-1}}(t_{k-1})\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{m_{1}}(t_{1})\hat{\rho}_{0}\hat{\Pi}_{m_{1}}(t_{1})\cdots\hat{\Pi}_{m_{k-1}}(t_{k-1})\hat{\Pi}_{m_{k}}(t_{k})\big)\notag\\
&=\bra{j,m_{1}}\hat{\rho}_{0}\ket{j,m_{1}}\prod_{i=1}^{k-1}{\big|d_{m_{i+1}m_{i}}^{j}(\beta_{i,i+1})\big|^{2}},
\end{align}
where $\beta_{ij}=\omega(t_{j}-t_{i})$ denotes the rotation angle about $y$-axis, $\hat{\rho}_{0}$ is the density operator of initial state, and $d_{mn}^{j}(\beta)=\bra{j,n}\exp(-i\beta\hat{J}_{y}/\hbar)\ket{j,m}$ are the Wigner $d$-matrix elements.

As observed in previous works \cite{XLZG11,CRS+20}, the quantum properties of a system may gradually diminish with the state purity decreases. Previous research \cite{BE14,MDH16} has reported violations of certain LGI in the large-spin limit for pure states and specific parameter settings. Here, we explore the ``maximally classical'' scenario in which the initial state is maximally mixed $\hat{\rho}=\hat{I}/(2j+1)$, ensuring that the system initially possesses no quantum coherence. In this case, quantum mechanical joint entropies are simplified as
\begin{equation}
H\big(Q^{(\alpha)}(t_{i}),\cdots,Q^{(\alpha)}(t_{l})\big)=\ln{(2j+1)}+\sum_{s,s'}{H_{j}(\beta_{s,s'})}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $s$ and $s'$ are adjacent measurements in the $\alpha$-th experiment, and $H_{j}(\beta)$ is the ``entropy'' of the Wigner matrix element, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Wigner-entropy}
H_{j}(\beta):=-\frac{1}{2j+1}\sum_{m,n=-j}^{j}{\big|d_{nm}^{j}(\beta)\big|^{2}\ln{\big|d_{nm}^{j}(\beta)\big|^{2}}}\ .
\end{equation}

Based on the above analysis, the expressions of $\mathcal{D}_{i}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{i,k}$ are simplified into
\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}_{i}&=H_{j}(\beta_{i-1,i})+H_{j}(\beta_{i,i+1})-H_{j}(\beta_{i-1,i+1})\ ;\\
\mathcal{D}_{i,k}&=\begin{cases}
H_{j}(\beta_{i,i+2})+H_{j}(\beta_{i-1,i+1})-H_{j}(\beta_{i,i+1})-H_{j}(\beta_{i-1,i+2}),&k=i+1\ ;\\
0,&k>i+1\ ;
\end{cases}\label{eqn:mutual-information-simplified}
\end{align}
where the conditions $i\ne1,n$ and $k\ne n$ hold. For boundary cases, the expression reads
\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}_{i}&=\begin{cases}
H_{j}(\beta_{1,2}),&i=1\ ;\\
H_{j}(\beta_{n-1,n}),&i=n\ .
\end{cases}\\
\mathcal{D}_{i,i+1}&=\begin{cases}
H_{j}(\beta_{1,3})-H_{j}(\beta_{1,2}),&i=1,n\ne2\ ;\\
H_{j}(\beta_{n-2,n})-H_{j}(\beta_{n-1,n}),&i=n-1,n\ne2\ ;\\
-H_{j}(\beta_{1,2}),&i=1,n=2\ .
\end{cases}
\end{align}
As will be shown in \cref{eqn:positive-WKB}, in the macroscopic limit $j\to\infty$, $\mathcal{D}_{i}\to+\infty$, and thus remains non-negative. Consequently, only ELGIs of the form $\mathcal{D}_{i,i+1}\ge0$ are capable of detecting macroscopic quantum violations.

Rigorous calculation of ELGIs in spin system involves inevitable computation of $H_{j}(\beta)$, which raises significant challenges to both numerical and analytical treatments, due to the mathematical complexity of the Wigner $d$-matrix elements $d_{mn}^{j}(\beta)$ \cite{FWYJ15,Hof18,WGWS22}. Instead, we then employ the WKB method \cite{BM72} for sufficiently large $j$. It is noteworthy that the spin system under consideration admits the symmetric top as a classical analogue \cite{Wig59}, with the  Schr\"odinger equation \cite{KR27} given by
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}\beta^{2}}+\frac{\cos{\beta}}{\sin{\beta}}\frac{\mathrm{d}} {\mathrm{d}\beta}+j(j+1)-\frac{m^{2}-2mn\cos{\beta}+n^{2}}{\sin^{2}{\beta}}\right)d_{mn}^{j}(\beta)=0\ .
\end{equation}
Here $m$ and $n$ denote the angular momentum components along the rotation axis and the $z$-axis, respectively; $\beta$ represents the angle between these two axes; and $j$ is the total angular momentum. For most parameter settings, we obtain the asymptotic expression
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:semi-approx}
H_{j}(\beta)=\ln{(2j+1)\pi}+\ln{|\sin{\beta}|}-\frac{5}{2}+o(1)\ .
\end{equation}
Note that the above asymptotic expression diverges as $\beta\to k\pi\,(k\in\mathbb{Z})$, indicating the semiclassical approximation tends to be invalid, which will be addressed in next section. Substituting $H_{j}(\beta)$ into \cref{eqn:mutual-information-simplified}, we obtain
\begin{align}
\mathcal{D}_{i}&=\ln{(2j+1)\pi}+\ln{\left|1+\tan{\beta_{i-1,i}}\tan{\beta_{i,i+1}}\right|}-\frac{5}{2}+o(1)\ ,\label{eqn:positive-WKB}\\
\mathcal{D}_{i,i+1}&=\ln{\left|\frac{\sin{\beta_{i-1,i+1}}\sin{\beta_{i,i+2}}}{\sin{\beta_{i-1,i+2}}\sin{\beta_{i,i+1}}}\right|} + o(1)\ ,\label{eqn:ELGI-violation}
\end{align}
which demonstrates that the maximal violation of the ELGI is of order $O(1)$. More precisely, as $j \to +\infty$, the absolute magnitude of ELGI violation converges to a value determined solely by the measurement time intervals, as specified by the rotation angles $\beta_{i,i+1}$. However, since the von Neumann entropy $S(\hat{\rho})$ of the system grows logarithmically with $j$ as $S(\hat{\rho})=\ln{(2j+1)}$, the relative violation, expressed as the ratio of the violation magnitude to the system entropy, declines logarithmically to zero as $j$ increases.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pic/asymptotic-violation.png}
\caption{{\bfseries Comparison of numerical results with asymptotic limits.} $n=3$ measurement time points are considered, and the rotation angles are set as $\beta_{1,2}=2\beta$ and $\beta_{2,3}=\beta$, yielding an asymptotic limit of $\mathcal{D}_{2,3}=-\ln{|\sin{3\beta}/\sin{\beta}|}$. Because of the symmetry of the Wigner $d$-matrix, calculations are restricted to $0\le\beta\le\pi$ without loss of generality. Apart from the divergence at $\beta=\pi/3$, where $\beta_{1,3}\to\pi$, the numerical results closely match the asymptotic limit as the spin $j$ increases.}\label{fig:fig-3}
\end{figure}

Although the derivation of \cref{eqn:ELGI-violation} employs the Shannon cone approximation, considering that distance between the boundaries of $\Gamma_{\text{Sh}}$ and $\Gamma_{\text{E}}$ is a constant independent of $j$, the discussion above can be extended to any entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities, not only the Shannon-type ones. From experimental perspective, quantum violation tends progressively to be more challenging to detect at larger scales, as the violation signal being obscured by the logarithmic expansion of background entropy, like searching for tiny shells in a rising tide. This result supports the emergence of macrorealism at macroscopic scales, even without the coarse-grained measurements introduced by Kofler and Brukner \cite{KB07,KB08} to explain the quantum-to-classical transition.

\section{Macroscopic quantum violations beyond the WKB approximation}

Although the numerical results generally agree with the asymptotic limit across most parameter ranges, as illustrated in \cref{fig:fig-3}, there are exceptions identified in Proposition 3 exhibiting trouble divergences. Kofler and Brukner \cite{KB07} provided a relevant example, showing that quantum violation of the maximally mixed state near $\beta=0$ persist in the $j\to+\infty$ limit. We further demonstrate that such a phenomenon applies to the discrete sequence $\beta = n\pi\,(n\in\mathbb{Z})$, arising from the failure of the WKB approximation.

In preceding section, the Schr\"odinger equation is handled by means of the WKB approximation, with the solution assumed to take the form of $d_{mn}^{j}(\beta) \approx Ae^{iS(\beta)}$. Here, $S(\beta)$ denotes the action associated with the nutation angle $\beta$, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:quantum-action}
S(\beta)=\int_{\beta_{0}}^{\beta}{\frac{\sqrt{J^{2}\sin^{2}{\alpha}-m^{2}-n^{2}+2mn\cos{\alpha}}}{J\sin{\alpha}}\,\mathrm{d}\alpha}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{0}$ denotes the zero of the integrand, and $J=j+1/2$ for simplicity. The Schr\"odinger equation reduces to the Hamilton--Jacobi equation in the limit $\hbar\to0$, causing the quantum action to coincide with its classical analogue. According to \cref{eqn:quantum-action}, however, the quantum action can be real or purely imaginary, depending on the sign of the discriminant $R(m,n,\beta)=J^{2}\sin^{2}{\beta}-m^{2}-n^{2}+2mn\cos{\beta}$, whereas the classical action must be real. Imaginary action corresponds to a trajectory in phase space denied by classical mechanics, as the canonical variables are complex \cite{BT57,BGHS96,BL98}. Hence, for a fixed rotation angle $\beta$, the Wigner $d$-matrix elements $d_{mn}^{j}(\beta)$ can be divided into two regions, as shown in \cref{fig:fig-4}: a ``classically allowed'' region with real action, characterized by rapid oscillations; and a ``classically forbidden'' region with imaginary action, where the matrix elements exponentially decays.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{pic/WKB-approximation.png}
\caption{{\bfseries Numerical calculation of Wigner $\bm{d}$-matrix elements.} Wigner $d$-matrix elements $d_{mn}^{j}(\beta)$ are calculated at rotation angles $\beta=\pi/12,\pi/6,\pi/3,\pi/2$ for $j=200$, and plotted on semi-logarithmic axes. The elliptical region with rapid oscillations corresponds to the classically allowed region, while outside the boundary the matrix elements exhibit exponential decay in classically forbidden region. As $\beta$ decreases from $\pi/2$ to zero, the ellipse’s eccentricity increases until it degenerates into a line at $\beta=0$ (not shown).}\label{fig:fig-4}
\end{figure}

Though the WKB approximation proves accurate in both domains, it diverges near the classical-quantum boundary, which, for most parameter settings, proves to be inconsequential in \cref{sec:large-spin}. For instance, in the calculation of $H_{j}(\beta)$, analysis indicates that the semi-classical approximation fails within a boundary layer of width $\delta\sim j^{-1/3}$, where the number of matrix elements is an infinitesimal compared to the classically allowed region, and hence the WKB approximation is legitimate to apply to the leading-order asymptotic terms.

Nevertheless, when $\beta\to n\pi\,(n\in\mathbb{Z})$, the classically allowed region degenerates from an ellipse to a line, causing the WKB approximation fail entirely within the neighborhood of width $\Delta\beta\sim j^{-1}$. In this regime, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_{i,i+1}\sim\begin{cases}
-\ln{(2j+1)}+O(\beta^{2}),&\beta_{i,i+1}\to n\pi\ ;\\
\ln{(2j+1)}+O(\beta^{2}),&\beta_{i-1,i}\to n\pi\ \text{or}\ \beta_{i+1,i+2}\to n\pi;
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
which indicates when $\beta_{i,i+1}\to n\pi\,(n\in\mathbb{Z})$, the quantum violation approaches to maximum rapidly. This result provides an experimental evidence of contradiction between quantum mechanics and the classical worldview. Remarkably, the magnitude of the quantum violation increases with the scale of the system, while the quantum resources required do not scale accordingly, as the conclusion is drawn from maximally mixed state.

This counterintuitive conclusion arises from the simple fact that, the ensemble average of the time correlation is not equal to the time correlation of the ensemble average. Consequently, the correlations observed from sequential measurements provide a more comprehensive characterization of quantum phenomena, which is inaccessible per analysis of the dynamical evolution of density matrix alone.

\section{Conclusion and outlook}

Starting with the general framework of the entropic Leggett–Garg inequality, we derive systematically the necessary conditions for quantum violation, exhibiting the failure of macrorealism. Our approach enables the ELGI to involve high-order temporal correlations, substantially expanding both the range and magnitude of quantum violation. This enhancement can not only facilitate the practical detection of quantum violation, also allow ELGI to witness non-Markovianity \cite{SLS+13} and other properties of dynamical process.

As discussed in preceding sections, an essential motivation of studying LGIs and ELGIs is to distinguish genuine quantum coherence from classical statistical mixtures. Coherence measures based on system's instantaneous state are insufficient for such purpose. Notably, our specific analysis of a spin system driven by a constant external field demonstrates that, even when the system remains in a maximally mixed state, the ELGIs can detect quantum violations across most parameter regions. This finding highlights the sensitivity of ELGI to temporal correlations, enabling a more refined characterization of coherent evolution.

The WKB analysis in large-spin limit reveals that, for an initially maximally mixed system, quantum violation occurs exclusively in ELGIs of the form $\mathcal{D}_{i,i+1}\ge0$. However, the magnitude of quantum violation tends to be a finite constant as the system size increases, which implies the increasing challenge in detecting quantum violation in large-scale system. Nevertheless, in the degenerate case where the rotation angle $\beta_{i,i+1}\to k\pi$, the quantum violation rapidly approaches the maximal value $\mathcal{D}_{i,i+1}\to-\ln{(2j+1)}$. This observation provides a clear pathway for quantum violation detection in large-scale system and for the detection of fundamental boundaries of quantum mechanics.

Finally, since the analysis is limited to unitary evolution, a natural question arises that whether macroscopic quantum violations can still persist in open system subject to dissipation or not. If not, how do such violations diminish as the strength of dissipation increases? Further investigation of this open question will advance our understanding of the decoherence mechanism, by which quantum systems become effectively classical at macroscopic scales, and will clarify the potential of the ELGI framework.
